418,Att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk.,0
419,The plastic breaks really easy on this clip.,0
420,Price is good too.,1
421,Don't make the same mistake I did.,0
422,Oh and I forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone.,0
423,I'm using it with an iriver SPINN (with case) and it fits fine.,1
424,Also the area where my unit broke).- I'm not too fond of the magnetic strap.,0
425,Overall I am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception.,1
426,every thing on phone work perfectly she like it.,1
427,Another note about this phone's appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model.,0
428,IT'S REALLY EASY.,1
429,My Sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect.,1
430,Fantastic earphones.,1
431,It finds my cell phone right away when I enter the car.,1
432,Low Quality.,0
433,I highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone.,1
434,But it does get better reception and clarity than any phone I've had before.,1
435,Warning - Stay away.,0
436,I wish I could return the unit and get back my money.,0
437,Awsome Device Works Great!!.,1
438,I used to talk on it for 1 - 1 1/2 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying.,0
439,If you don't find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad only.I would not recommend this to anyone.,0
440,Very Displeased.,0
441,I might have gotten a defect but I would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone.,0
442,They made this case too small and is very difficult to install.,0
443,Restored my phone to like new performance.,1
444,I would recommend purchasing the Jabra JX-10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my Moto Q go figure.,1
445,I searched the Internet and found this one to be the best value.,1
446,Does not fit.,0
447,Very happy with this product.,1
448,The screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone.,1
449,There's really nothing bad I can say about this headset.,0
450,i'm glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasn't high priced.,1
451,Portable and it works.,1
452,My colleague & I now get great reception.A little expensive but performance is great.,1
453,I even fully charged it before I went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wi-fi and noticed that it only had 20 % left in the morning.,0
454,I've also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which I always turn it on and then off again.,0
455,Not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses.,0
456,Timely shipment and quality product.,1
457,Nice solid keyboard.,1
458,Very well made and fits my Surefire GX2 perfectly.,1
459,Horrible phone.,0
460,BT50 battery junk!.,0
461,We would recommend these to others.,1
462,Cant get the software to work with my computer.,0
463,Disappointed!.,0
464,poor voice clarity.,0
465,The battery works great!,1
466,No buyers remorse on this one!.,0
467,Very disappointed in AccessoryOne.,0
468,I find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers.,0
469,"Looks great and is strong.""",1
470,I have had TMobile service for 2 or 3 years now and I am pretty happy with it.,1
471,The update procedure is difficult and cumbersome.,0
472,Disappointment.. I hate anything that goes in my ear.,0
473,Great software for Motorolas.,1
474,The delivery was on time.,1
475,Very easy to use.,1
476,Uncomfortable In the Ear Don't use with LG VX9900 (EnV).,0
477,The volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown.,0
478,It holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under long-wearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous.,1
479,I'd like to return it.,0
480,The keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough I don't expect any problems.,1
481,Verizon's bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple.,0
482,After charging overnight these batteries work great.,1
483,You won't regret it!,1
484,I love this phone!.,1
485,A Disappointment.,0
486,Its not user friendly.,0
487,Unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect.,0
488,Then I exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem.,0
489,This results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute.,0
490,This PDA rocks.,1
491,It is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtop/camera/cellphone and excels in those roles.,1
492,I would definitely recommend the Jabra BT250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price!,1
493,I had Verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service.,1
494,Pretty piece of junk.,0
495,Plug was the wrong size.,0
496,Works as described.,1
497,Save your money.... I've had this item for 11 months now.,0
498,Bad Purchase.,0
499,WELL IM SATISFIED.,1
500,The bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a NYC commuter.,1
501,This battery is an excellent bargain!,1
502,Defective crap.,0
503,I would have given no star if I was able.,0
504,I wear glasses and it fits fine with them.,1
505,The sound quality for the device is unacceptable.Unless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing.,0
506,I would not recommend this item to anyone.,0
507,The holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad.,0
508,great...no problems at all!.,1
509,As an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens.,0
510,This frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching.,1
511,You never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not.,0
512,The sound is clear and the people I talk to on it are amazed at the quality too.,1
513,I got the aluminum case for my new Palm VX and it worked really well--it has protected my handheld perfectly so far.,1
514,very good product well made.,1
515,Mobile Phone Tools are a must have.,1
516,I am very impressed with the job that Motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone.,1
517,I received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall I am very excited to have this source.,1
518,The phone is sturdy and waterproof.,1
519,I am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone.,0
520,My only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5(of 5),0
521,Thanks again to Amazon for having the things I need for a good price!,1
522,I ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead.,1
523,I had to go to a store and bought a new NOKIA phone which is working great.,1
524,Works great!.,1
525,REALLY UGLY.,0
526,horrible had to switch 3 times.,0
527,The noise shield is incrediable.,1
528,No real improvement.,0
529,Razr Battery - Good buy.,1
530,Keep up the good work Amazon!!,1
531,They refuse to refund or replace.,0
532,Unfortunately it's easy to accidentally activate them with the gentle-touch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening.,0
533,So I basically threw my money out the window for nothing.,0
534,Great case and price!,1
535,All it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was cracked.I am not impressed and I am not laughing.,0
536,Bluetooth range is good - a few days ago I left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch.,1
537,Small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place.,1
538,The eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity.,1
539,none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly.,0
540,I am glad I purchased it.,1
541,I've missed numerous calls because of this reason.,0
542,Perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when I use this.,0
543,Don't buy this product.,0
544,sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone.,0
545,No shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch NOTHING!I couldn't be more happier with my new one for the Droid.,1
546,Worst software ever used.... If I could give this zero stars I would.,0
547,Trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration.,0
548,The case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever.,0
549,I own a Jabra Earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better.,1
550,I love the camera it's really pretty good quality.,1
551,Thank you for such great service.,1
552,Its a total package.,1
553,The seller is very understanding and patient I would definitely buy from them again.,1
554,I give Wirefly 1 star.I will contact Cingular/AT&T and inform them of this practice.,0
555,It's AGGRAVATING!,0
556,Great product for the price!.,1
557,I have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use,1
558,Virgin Wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone!,1
559,None of it works just don't buy it.,0
560,Muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wire's insert was poorly super glued and slid off.,0
561,Please dont waste your money.,0
562,All in all I'm quite satisfied with this purchase.,1
563,If you are looking for a good quality Motorola Headset keep looking this isn't it.,0
564,Yet Plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design.,0
565,Disapointing Results.,0
566,Cumbersome design.,0
567,Great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then I expected!!!!,1
568,Great Product.,1
569,It's A PIECE OF CRAP!,0
570,My experience was terrible..... This was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last Jabra (which I HATED!!!,0
571,This fixes all the problems.,1
572,Worst ever.,0
573,I am very happy,1
574,I've had no trouble accessing the Internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions.,1
575,"I can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying ""what?""",0
576,The battery life is highly unacceptable.,0
577,That company is a joke.,0
578,It does everything the description said it would.,1
579,Due to this happening on every call I was forced to stop using this headset.,0
580,It works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time.,1
581,Verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and I ended up having to do a hard re-set wiping out all my data.,0
582,Voice Quality Signal Strength Dropped Calls.,0
583,It plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however it's not.,1
584,Better than expected.,1
585,It feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them.,0
586,Battery is holding up well.,1
587,Also difficult to put on.I'd recommend avoiding this product.,0
588,I only used it two days and it wasn't always easy to hear with.,0
589,I got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was broken...I went to plug it in and it started smoking.,0
590,Sprint - terrible customer service.,0
591,Linked to my phone without effort.,1
592,THey are so cool!,1
593,Easy to use.,1
594,Better Than New.,1
595,What possesed me to get this junk I have no idea...,0
596,Piece of trash.,0
597,A pretty good product.,1
598,This is a great phone!.,1
599,For the price on Amazon it is an excellent product which I would highly recommend.,1
600,Their Research and Development division obviously knows what they're doing.,1
601,The real killer is the volume and of course it breaking.,0
602,Those phones are working just fine now.,1
603,I am more than happy with this product.,1
604,Poor Construction.,0
605,This is infuriating.,0
606,Overall I would recommend this phone over the new Walkman.,1
607,Sprint charges for this service.,0
608,It is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap.,0
609,It fits my ear well and is comfortable on.,1
610,It doesn't work in Europe or Asia.,0
611,clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cent's up-and-coming.,1
612,I like design and look of Jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear.,1
613,I was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price.,1
614,the worst phone from samsung...crap..... this crappy Samsung E715.. is the worst i have ever seeen.,0
615,the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone.,0
616,Poor product.,0
617,However I needed some better instructions.,0
618,You need two hands to operate the screen.This software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs.,0
619,Worked very well paired with a Treo 700w and as a Skype headset on my PC (using a USB Bluetooth transceiver).,1
620,Steer clear of this product and go with the genuine Palm replacementr pens which come in a three-pack.,0
621,DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUYIT SUCKS,0
622,This is a great product..... sure beats using your fingers!.,1
623,Plus I seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point.,0
624,All the other cases I've tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul.,1
625,Very Dissapointing Performance.,0
626,Don't make the same mistake that I did and please don't buy this phone.,0
627,This phone might well be the worst I've ever had in any brand.,0
628,Case was more or less an extra that I originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear.,0
629,I recommend iGo to anyone with different brand cell phones/mp3 players in the family.,1
630,Don't bother - go to the store.,0
631,I posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the Fire Red and it's a great color!,1
632,I did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed.,1
633,You get what you pay for I guess.,0
634,Not only did the software do a great job of this I could also make my own ringtones form my existing CDs without an internet connection.,1
635,im surprised this is a good quality car charger and there's not much reviews about it.,1
636,These are fabulous!,1
637,However BT headsets are currently not good for real time games like first-person shooters since the audio delay messes me up.,0
638,I used bitpim (a free program you can find on the internet)to transfer data to the phone.The price of the cable was excellent.,1
639,Disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer.,0
640,Performed awful -- muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call.,0
641,Very wind-resistant.,1
642,Obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for.,0
643,They do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replace.Easy to operate and the sound is much better than others I have tried.,1
644,I contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if I couldn't produce my receipt I was out of luck.,0
645,Linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something!,0
646,Phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are.,1
647,Great phone.,1
648,When I placed my treo into the case not only was it NOT snug but there was A LOT of extra room on the sides.,0
649,I'm pleased.,1
650,Battery is terrible.,0
651,I found the product to be easy to set up and use.,1
652,The earpiece on this is too large or too heavy...it keeps falling out of my ear.,0
653,Utter crap.. Sound quality is TERRIBLE.,0
654,The charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work.,0
655,No ear loop needed it's tiny and the sound is great.,1
656,Finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and I could not use it any longer on the visor.,0
657,The handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the Treo reboots.Overall I still rate this device high.,1
658,Talk about USELESS customer service.,0
659,"It felt too light and ""tinny."".",0
660,This does not fit the Palm Tungsten E2 and it broke the first time I tried to plug it in.,0
661,I'm happy about this purchase- good quality and low price.,1
662,I love the look and feel of Samsung flipphones.,1
663,Its well-designed and very sharp -- the blue is a very nice color.,1
664,Does everything it should and more.,1
665,I could not recommend these more.,0
666,Nice Sound.,1
667,Looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment!!,0
668,Much less than the jawbone I was going to replace it with.,1
669,Setup went very smoothly.,1
670,its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it.,0
671,"A must study for anyone interested in the ""worst sins"" of industrial design.",0
672,The first thing that happened was that the tracking was off.,0
673,It is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip.,1
674,Then I had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping.,0
675,Can't upload ringtones from a third party.,0
676,Bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked.,0
677,Truly awful.,0
678,It works fine on my Motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the worn-out battery did.,1
679,The volume for the ringer is REAL good (you have choices how loud).,1
680,And none of the tones is acceptable.,0
681,camera color balance is AWFUL.,0
682,This product is clearly not ready for prime time I don't care how cool it looks if you can't tell a call is coming in it's worthless.,0
683,I love the ringtones because they are so upbeat!,1
684,Chinese Forgeries Abound!.,0
685,Easy to pair with my Samsung Cell.,1
686,The instructions didn't explain that a microphone jack could be used.,0
687,i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well.,0
688,Too bad you have to pay up to $$$ a month for the service!,0
689,Works well.,1
690,The nokia CA-42 USB cable did not work with my phone.,0
691,Clear crisp sound.,1
692,I have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well.,1
693,The biggest complaint I have is the battery drains superfast.,0
694,The design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand having these in my ear.,0
695,Do NOT buy if you want to use the holster.,0
696,The phone can also take great pictures and even video clips.,1
697,It doesn't make you look cool.,0
698,Because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all.,1
699,Comfortable fit - you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day.,1
700,Also the phone doesn't seem to accept anything except CBR mp3s preferably ripped by Windows Media Player.,0
701,You can't beat the price on these.,1
702,* Comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash SOS signals (seriously!,1
703,lightweight and works well.,1
704,So just beware.,0
705,I love this cable - it allows me to connect any mini-USB device to my PC.,1
706,So anyone near you will hear part of your conversation.,0
707,This is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up.,1
708,I bought this phone as a replacement for my StarTac and have regretted it since.,0
709,Appears to actually outperform the original battery from China that came with my V325i.,1
710,Can't store anything but phone numbers to SIM.,0
711,It lasts less than 3o minutes if I actually try to use the phone.My wife has the same phone with the same problem.,0
712,Poor quality.,0
713,"jabra ear gels ""R"" the best!.",1
714,Not worth it.,0
715,The phone crashed completely and now I have to get it replaced.,0
716,It quit working after I'd used it for about 18 months so I just purchased another one because this is the best headset I've ever owned.,1
717,Unfortunately it will not recharge my iPhone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources (iMac external battery wall outlet etc).,0
718,It was a great phone.,1
719,if you simply want a small flip phone -- look elsewhere as the extra bells & whistles are mediocre.,0
720,Good value works fine - power via USB car or wall outlet.,1
721,My phone doesn't slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand.,1
722,This is simply the BEST bluetooth headset for sound quality!,1
723,Think it over when you plan to own this one!This sure is the last MOTO phone for me!,0
724,"In the span of an hour I had two people exclaim ""Whoa - is that the new phone on TV?!?",1
725,I have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful.,1
726,This case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100% functional.,1
727,Other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape.,1
728,It has everything I need and I couldn't ask for more.,1
729,After receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke.,0
730,This product is great... it makes working a lot easier I can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something.,1
731,None of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears.,0
732,T-Mobile has the best customer service anywhere.,1
733,Arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold.,1
734,We have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months.. Pros,0
735,Provides good protection and looks classy too.,1
736,Krussel Always good.,1
737,The tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc.,1
738,The design is very good.4.,1
739,I great reception all the time.,1
740,I would highly recommend this product.,1
741,Couldn't use the unit with sunglasses not good in Texas!,0
742,It dit not work most of the time with my Nokia 5320.,0
743,Bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing.,0
744,If you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you!,0
745,Fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is,1
746,stay away from this store be careful.,0
747,This BlueAnt Supertooth hands-free phone speaker is AWESOME.,1
748,Does not fit.,0
749,.... Item arrived quickly and works great with my Metro PCS Samsung SCH-r450 slider phone and Sony Premium Sound in ear plugs.,1
750,It is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time.,1
751,disappointing.,0
752,Blue Ant is easy to use.,1
753,Cheap but hey it works.. Was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item.,1
754,The camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors... I'd rather be using a disposable then this.,0
755,Then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use.,0
756,It's very convenient and simple to use - gets job done & makes the car ride so much smoother.,1
757,The nano stated it.My son was dissapointed.,0
758,The sound quality is excellent as well.,1
759,Its the best headset I have used.,1
760,Would not reccommend.,0
761,They have been around for years and carries the highest quality of anti-glare screen protector that I have found to date.,1
762,Just what I wanted.,1
763,This particular model would not work with my Motorola Q smartphone.,0
764,wont work right or atleast for me.,0
765,in addition it feels &amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic.,0
766,"But now that it is ""out of warranty"" the same problems reoccure.Bottom line... put your money somewhere else... Cingular will not support it.",0
767,I really wanted the Plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for me.The good,0
768,Great product.,1
769,Crisp and Clear.,1
770,AFter the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes.,0
771,VERY cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor.,0
772,I get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones I have not had this problem.,0
773,The reception has been generally good.,1
774,Excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot!.,1
775,Great bluetooth!.,1
776,I highly recommend this case.,1
777,WORTHWHILE.,1
778,This is a great deal.,1
779,After my phone got to be about a year old it's been slowly breaking despite much care on my part.,0
780,I am sorry I made this purchase.,0
781,I bought these hoping I could make my Bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear.,0
782,Treo and T-Mobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount.,0
783,It was horrible!.,0
784,I don't think it would hold it too securly on your belt.,0
785,This allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first.,0
786,They work about 2 weeks then break.,0
787,It is simple to use and I like it.,1
788,It's a great tool for entertainment communication and data management.Oh be sure to use ActiveSync 4.2 for optimal data synchronization results!,1
789,I can't use this case because the smell is disgusting.,0
790,NOT WHAT I WANTED.,0
791,I own 2 of these cases and would order another.,1
792,Great Phone.,1
793,I bought this battery with a coupon from Amazon and I'm very happy with my purchase.,1
794,The internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked.,0

861,It was a waste of my money.,0
862,So far it has worked like a charm.,1
863,I have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good.,1
864,But in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using IR or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone.,1
865,Would recommend this item.,1
866,It's been my choice headset for years.Great sound good volume good noise cancellation.,1
867,Nice case feels good in your hands.,1

875,This is by far the worst purchase I've made on Amazon.,0

882,The only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears.,1

885,When it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off.,0
886,I didn't want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort.,0
887,Best headset ever!!!.,1
888,Don't trust their website and don't expect any helpful support.,0
889,It was that loud.Glad to say that the Plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use.,1
890,The speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap.,0
891,Fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips.,1

893,Bad Reception.,0
894,This product is very High quality Chinese CRAP!!!!!!,0
895,It was quite comfortable in the ear.,1
896,Great phone.,1
897,Don't buy this product - It fails!.,0
898,Everything about this product is wrong.First,0
899,The pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before I started making calls with the voice dialing feature.,1
900,This was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts.,0
901,Terrible phone holder.,0
902,The cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly.,1
903,I love being able to use one headset for both by land-line and cell.,1
904,Problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily.,0
905,Not nearly as good looking as the AMAZON picture makes it look.,0
906,But despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official OEM product.,1
907,How stupid is that?,0
908,I can hear while I'm driving in the car and usually don't even have to put it on it's loudest setting.,1
909,Seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors.,1
910,Good show Samsung.,1
911,So I bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money.,1
912,It always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed.,0
913,Couldn't figure it out,0
914,My phone sounded OK ( not great - OK) but my wife's phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldn't understand a word being said on it.,0
915,So I had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it.,0
916,While I managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop.,0
917,Leopard Print is wonderfully wild!.,1
918,Works for me.,1
919,Saggy floppy piece of junk.,0
920,much better than the hard plastic cases.,1
921,It also had a new problem.,0
922,Happy so far!.,1
923,cool phone.,1
924,Works good.,1
925,Motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right.,1
926,It looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two.,0
927,but it is great i would really recommend it,1
928,Makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when I'm not wearing it.,0
929,As I said above....PRETTY USELESS!,0
930,Never got it!!!!!,0
931,This pair of headphones is the worst that I have ever had sound-wise.,0
932,[...] down the drain because of a weak snap!,0
933,Does not charge the Cingular (ATT) 8525 phone.,0
934,"You get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off.""",1
935,However after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and I couldn't receive and place calls.,0
936,I kept catching the cable on the seat and I had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off.,0
937,The headset fulfills my requirements so I am happy with my purchase.,1
938,Logitech Bluetooth Headset is a 10!.,1
939,I like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside.,1
940,A lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do I.,1
941,I have tried these cables with my computer and my iPod and it works just fine.,1
942,The mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low.,0
943,I'm returning them.,0
944,I does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap.,0
945,It is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable.,1
946,I have had mine for about a year and this Christmas I bought some for the rest of the family.,1
947,Otherwise easy to install and use clear sound.,1
948,nice leather.,1
949,I had to purchase a different case.,0
950,It is a joy to use.,1
951,Very much disappointed with this company.,0
952,Very satisifed with that.,1
953,It didn't charge for me.,0
954,This is the phone to get for 2005.... I just bought my S710a and all I can say is WOW!,1
955,Buttons are too small.,0
956,Just reading on the specs alone makes you say WOW.,1
957,Love it.. Great armband.,1
958,I really like this product over the Motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic.,1
959,However the keypads are so tinny that I sometimes reach the wrong buttons.,0
960,I exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and I'm pretty happy with that decision.,1
961,I was very impressed with the price of the cases.,1
962,Also makes it easier to hold on to.,1
963,I use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great!,1
964,It's pretty easy.,1
965,I cannot make calls at certain places.,0
966,however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesn't wake up like normal phone does.,0
967,Beautiful styling though.,1

971,Excellent product.,1
972,Earbud piece breaks easily.,0
973,Lousy product.,0
974,This phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at it's very ability to be a phone.,0
975,It is the best charger I have seen on the market yet.,1
976,SWEETEST PHONE!!!,1
977,:-)Oh the charger seems to work fine.,1
978,It fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal.,1
979,Not enough volume.,0
980,Echo Problem....Very unsatisfactory,0
981,you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor.,0
982,don't waste your money.,0
983,I am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product.,0
984,Adapter does not provide enough charging current.,0
985,There was so much hype over this phone that I assumed it was the best my mistake.,0
986,You also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered.,0
987,Phone falls out easily.,0
988,It didn't work people can not hear me when I talk.,0
989,The text messaging feature is really tricky to use.,0

1000,Wow... Loved this place.,1
1001,Crust is not good.,0
1002,Not tasty and the texture was just nasty.,0

1004,The selection on the menu was great and so were the prices.,1
1005,Now I am getting angry and I want my damn pho.,0
1006,Honeslty it didn't taste THAT fresh.),0
1007,The potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer.,0
1008,The fries were great too.,1
1009,A great touch.,1
1010,Service was very prompt.,1
1011,Would not go back.,0
1012,The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced.,0
1013,I tried the Cape Cod ravoli chickenwith cranberry...mmmm!,1
1014,I was disgusted because I was pretty sure that was human hair.,0
1015,I was shocked because no signs indicate cash only.,0
1016,Highly recommended.,1
1017,Waitress was a little slow in service.,0
1018,This place is not worth your time let alone Vegas.,0

1020,The Burrittos Blah!,0
1021,The food amazing.,1
1022,Service is also cute.,1
1023,I could care less... The interior is just beautiful.,1
1024,So they performed.,1
1025,That's right....the red velvet cake.....ohhh this stuff is so good.,1
1026,- They never brought a salad we asked for.,0
1027,This hole in the wall has great Mexican street tacos and friendly staff.,1
1028,Took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was Luke warm Our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed.,0
1029,The worst was the salmon sashimi.,0
1030,Also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal.,1
1031,This was like the final blow!,0
1032,I found this place by accident and I could not be happier.,1
1033,seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.,0
1034,Overall I like this place a lot.,1
1035,The only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive.,1
1036,Ample portions and good prices.,1
1037,Poor service the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table.,0
1038,My first visit to Hiro was a delight!,1
1039,Service sucks.,0
1040,The shrimp tender and moist.,1
1041,There is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again.,0
1042,Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick.,0
1043,On a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service.,1
1044,Frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register.,0
1045,The only thing I did like was the prime rib and dessert section.,1
1046,It's too bad the food is so damn generic.,0
1047,The burger is good beef cooked just right.,1
1048,If you want a sandwich just go to any Firehouse!!!!!,1
1049,My side Greek salad with the Greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing.,1
1050,We ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside.,1
1051,He came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table.,1
1052,Their chow mein is so good!,1
1053,They have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers don't enjoy their food.,0
1054,The portion was huge!,1
1055,Loved it...friendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu.,1
1056,The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.,0
1057,Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.,0
1058,The salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked.,1
1059,The ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless.,0
1060,At least think to refill my water before I struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes.,0
1061,This place receives stars for their APPETIZERS!!!,1
1062,The cocktails are all handmade and delicious.,1
1063,We'd definitely go back here again.,1
1064,We are so glad we found this place.,1
1065,Great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount.,1
1066,Always a great time at Dos Gringos!,1
1067,Update.....went back for a second time and it was still just as amazing,1
1068,We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.,0
1069,A great way to finish a great.,1
1070,The deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and Jeff went above and beyond what we expected.,1
1071,- Really really good rice all the time.,1
1072,The service was meh.,0
1073,It took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk.,0
1074,I guess I should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the Excalibur but I didn't use my common sense.,0
1075,The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.,0
1076,2 times - Very Bad Customer Service !,0
1077,The sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well.,1
1078,Today is the second time I've been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good.,1
1079,There is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company.,0
1080,Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up.,0
1081,walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating.,0
1082,The turkey and roast beef were bland.,0
1083,This place has it!,1
1084,The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.,0
1085,I love the Pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try.,1
1086,The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.,0
1087,All I have to say is the food was amazing!!!,1
1088,Omelets are to die for!,1
1089,Everything was fresh and delicious!,1
1090,In summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience.,0
1091,It's like a really sexy party in your mouth where you're outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party.,1
1092,Never been to Hard Rock Casino before WILL NEVER EVER STEP FORWARD IN IT AGAIN!,0
1093,Best breakfast buffet!!!,1
1094,say bye bye to your tip lady!,0
1095,We'll never go again.,0
1096,Will be back again!,1
1097,Food arrived quickly!,1
1098,It was not good.,0
1099,On the up side their cafe serves really good food.,1
1100,Our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go!,1
1101,The only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy mary's coming.,1
1102,Best Buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it.,1
1103,I LOVED their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious.,1
1104,This is one of the better buffets that I have been to.,1
1105,So we went to Tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon!,1
1106,The food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable AND we got a great deal!,1
1107,The ambience is wonderful and there is music playing.,1
1108,Will go back next trip out.,1
1109,Sooooo good!!,1
1110,REAL sushi lovers let's be honest - Yama is not that good.,0
1111,At least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasn't that busy.,0
1112,This is a really fantastic Thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit.,1
1113,Nice spicy and tender.,1
1114,Good prices.,1
1115,Check it out.,1
1116,It was pretty gross!,0
1117,I've had better atmosphere.,0
1118,Kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did.,0
1119,Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing.,0
1120,I just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine.,0
1121,Worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries.,0
1122,Service was fine and the waitress was friendly.,1
1123,The guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak he's ever eaten.,1
1124,We thought you'd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night.,1
1125,Host staff were for lack of a better word BITCHES!,0
1126,Bland... Not a liking this place for a number of reasons and I don't want to waste time on bad reviewing.. I'll leave it at that...,0
1127,Phenomenal food service and ambiance.,1
1128,I wouldn't return.,0
1129,Definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time I'm in Vegas.,1
1130,This place is way too overpriced for mediocre food.,0
1131,Penne vodka excellent!,1
1132,They have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers.,1
1133,The management is rude.,0
1134,Delicious NYC bagels good selections of cream cheese real Lox with capers even.,1
1135,Great Subway in fact it's so good when you come here every other Subway will not meet your expectations.,1
1136,I had a seriously solid breakfast here.,1
1137,This is one of the best bars with food in Vegas.,1
1138,He was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas.,0
1139,My drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions.,1
1140,Don't do it!!!!,0
1141,The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.,0
1142,My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service.,0
1143,And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me.,0
1144,Nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food.,1
1145,The bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated.,1
1146,The menu is always changing food quality is going down & service is extremely slow.,0
1147,The service was a little slow  considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace.,0
1148,I give it 2 thumbs down,0
1149,We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us.,0
1150,My fiancé and I came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away.,1
1151,This is a great restaurant at the Mandalay Bay.,1
1152,We waited for forty five minutes in vain.,0
1153,Crostini that came with the salad was stale.,0
1154,Some highlights : Great quality nigiri here!,1
1155,the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean.,1
1156,this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored.,1
1157,I ordered the Voodoo pasta and it was the first time I'd had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago.,1
1158,this place is good.,1
1159,Unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was STALE.,0
1160,I came back today since they relocated and still not impressed.,0
1161,I was seated immediately.,1
1162,Their menu is diverse and reasonably priced.,1
1163,Avoid at all cost!,0
1164,Restaurant is always full but never a wait.,1
1165,DELICIOUS!!,1
1166,This place is hands-down one of the best places to eat in the Phoenix metro area.,1
1167,So don't go there if you are looking for good food...,0
1168,I've never been treated so bad.,0
1169,Bacon is hella salty.,1
1170,We also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste.,0
1171,This really is how Vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed.,1
1172,The waitresses are very friendly.,1
1173,Lordy the Khao Soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers!,1
1174,Everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter.,1
1175,Perhaps I caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but I'm not inspired to go back.,0
1176,The service here leaves a lot to be desired.,0
1177,The atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness.,1
1178,Not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while.,1
1179,We literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order.,0
1180,The burger had absolutely no flavor - the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor.,0
1181,I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack.,0
1182,I dressed up to be treated so rudely!,0
1183,It was probably dirt.,0
1184,Love this place hits the spot when I want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor.,1
1185,I ordered the Lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible.,1
1186,The food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined.,0
1187,Interesting decor.,1
1188,What I really like there is the crepe station.,1
1189,Also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on top....very original and very good.,1
1190,you can watch them preparing the delicious food!),1
1191,Both of the egg rolls were fantastic.,1
1192,When my order arrived one of the gyros was missing.,0
1193,I had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied.,1
1194,I'm not really sure how Joey's was voted best hot dog in the Valley by readers of Phoenix Magazine.,0
1195,The best place to go for a tasty bowl of Pho!,1
1196,The live music on Fridays totally blows.,0
1197,I've never been more insulted or felt disrespected.,0

1202,The warm beer didn't help.,0
1203,Great brunch spot.,1
1204,Service is friendly and inviting.,1
1205,Very good lunch spot.,1
1206,I've lived here since 1979 and this was the first (and last) time I've stepped foot into this place.,0
1207,The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.,0
1208,Must have been an off night at this place.,0
1209,The sides are delish - mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn - beateous.,1
1210,If that bug never showed up I would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen.,0

1217,The Jamaican mojitos are delicious.,1
1218,Which are small and not worth the price.,0
1219,- the food is rich so order accordingly.,1
1220,The shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you don't mind being nude for everyone to see!,0
1221,The service was a bit lacking.,0
1222,Lobster Bisque Bussell Sprouts Risotto Filet ALL needed salt and pepper..and of course there is none at the tables.,0
1223,Hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in.,0
1224,It was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad.,0
1225,I loved the bacon wrapped dates.,1
1226,This is an unbelievable BARGAIN!,1
1227,The folks at Otto always make us feel so welcome and special.,1
1228,"As for the ""mains also uninspired.	0
This is the place where I first had pho and it was amazing!!	1
This wonderful experience made this place a must-stop whenever we are in town again.	1
If the food isn't bad enough for you, then enjoy dealing with the world's worst/annoying drunk people.	0
Very very fun chef.	1
Ordered a double cheeseburger & got a single patty that was falling apart (picture uploaded) Yeah, still sucks.	0
Great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with TV's.	1
If it were possible to give them zero stars, they'd have it.	0
The descriptions said ""yum yum sauce"" and another said ""eel sauce yet another said ""spicy mayo""...well NONE of the rolls had sauces on them.",0
1229,I'd say that would be the hardest decision... Honestly all of M's dishes taste how they are supposed to taste (amazing).,1
1230,If she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed... Not sure if we will go back and try it again.,0
1231,Everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service.,1
1232,Horrible - don't waste your time and money.,0
1233,Now this dish was quite flavourful.,1

1235,(It wasn't busy either) Also the building was FREEZING cold.,0
1236,"like the other reviewer said ""you couldn't pay me to eat at this place again.""",0
1237,-Drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point.,0
1238,Seriously flavorful delights folks.,1
1239,Much better than the other AYCE sushi place I went to in Vegas.,1
1240,The lighting is just dark enough to set the mood.,1
1241,Based on the sub-par service I received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business I won't be going back.,0
1242,Owner's are really great people.!,1
1243,There is nothing privileged about working/eating there.,0
1244,The Greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful.,1
1245,Overall I don't think that I would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that I silently felt too.,0
1246,Now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty.,1
1247,We had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast.,1
1248,Fantastic service here.,1
1249,I as well would've given godfathers zero stars if possible.,0

1267,I've had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from Jenni Pho.,0
1268,I liked the patio and the service was outstanding.,1
1269,The goat taco didn't skimp on the meat and wow what FLAVOR!,1
1270,I think not again,0
1271,I had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so I will not be getting that again.,0
1272,I went to Bachi Burger on a friend's recommendation and was not disappointed.,1
1273,Service stinks here!,0

1292,Good beer & drink selection and good food selection.,1

1296,Good Service-check!,1
1297,This greedy corporation will NEVER see another dime from me!,0

1307,The bus boy on the other hand was so rude.,0
1308,By this point my friends and I had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known.,0
1309,Back to good BBQ lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways.,1
1310,And considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about $20 you just can't go wrong.,1
1311,All the bread is made in-house!,1

1316,Favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma!!!!!!,1
1317,The black eyed peas and sweet potatoes... UNREAL!,1
1318,You won't be disappointed.,1
1319,They could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good.,1
1320,I go to far too many places and I've never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for $4.00.,0

1376,WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK AND HAVE TOLD MANY PEOPLE WHAT HAD HAPPENED.,0
1377,I don't recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving.,0
1378,I will come back here every time I'm in Vegas.,1
1379,This place deserves one star and 90% has to do with the food.,0

1386,Service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is Vegas and located inside the Crystals shopping mall by Aria.,1

1415,We've tried to like this place but after 10+ times I think we're done with them.,0

1428,definitely will come back here again.,1
1429,I like Steiners because it's dark and it feels like a bar.,1

1433,I'd love to go back.,1
1434,Anyway this FS restaurant has a wonderful breakfast/lunch.,1
1435,Nothing special.,0

1445,I was so insulted.,0
1446,The last 3 times I had lunch here has been bad.,0
1447,The chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat I have ever eaten.,0

1450,Best tater tots in the southwest.,1
1451,We loved the place.,1
1452,Definitely not worth the $3 I paid.,0

1455,The manager was the worst.,0
1456,The inside is really quite nice and very clean.,1
1457,The food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable.,1
1458,I don't think I'll be running back to Carly's anytime soon for food.,0
1459,This is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our food...and they kept forgetting things.,0
1460,Love the margaritas too!,1
1461,This was my first and only Vegas buffet and it did not disappoint.,1

1471,I LOVED it!,1
1472,We asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didn't bring that either.,0
1473,This place is a jewel in Las Vegas and exactly what I've been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here.,1
1474,Seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh.,0
1475,The selection of food was not the best.,0
1476,Delicious and I will absolutely be back!,1
1477,This isn't a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment.,1
1478,They had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and I liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle.,1
1479,I dont think I will be back for a very long time.,0
1480,It was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign.,0
1481,How awesome is that.,1
1482,I will be back many times soon.,1
1483,The menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide!,1

1514,A greasy unhealthy meal.,0
1515,first time there and might just be the last.,0
1516,Those burgers were amazing.,1
1517,Similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late.,0
1518,And it was way to expensive.,0
1519,Be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it to-go - the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for.,1
1520,This was my first time and I can't wait until the next.,1
1521,The bartender was also nice.,1
1522,Everything was good and tasty!,1
1523,This place is two thumbs up....way up.,1

1537,Just spicy enough.. Perfect actually.,1
1538,Last night was my second time dining here and I was so happy I decided to go back!,1
1539,"not even a ""hello we will be right with you.""",0

1542,I really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place!,1
1543,Nice ambiance.,1
1544,I would recommend saving room for this!,1
1545,I guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful.,0
1546,However my recent experience at this particular location was not so good.,0
1547,I know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here!,0

1782,When I received my Pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there.,1
1783,Once your food arrives it's meh.,0
1784,Paying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal.,0
1785,The classic Maine Lobster Roll was fantastic.,1
1786,My brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too.,0

1797,I had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat.,0
1798,I could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine.,1
1799,Not a single employee came out to see if we were OK or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food.,0

1801,The first time I ever came here I had an amazing experience I still tell people how awesome the duck was.,1

1824,No one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it.,0
1825,Best service and food ever Maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day.,1
1826,They were excellent.,1
1827,I paid the bill but did not tip because I felt the server did a terrible job.,0
1828,Just had lunch here and had a great experience.,1
1829,I have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.,0
1830,Food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small.,0
1831,I recently tried Caballero's and I have been back every week since!,1
1832,for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food.,0

1841,Bad day or not I have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise!!,0
1842,the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit.,1
1843,I probably would not go here again.,0
1844,So flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat.,1
1845,The price is reasonable and the service is great.,1
1846,The Wife hated her meal (coconut shrimp) and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either.,0
1847,My fella got the huevos rancheros and they didn't look too appealing.,0
1848,Went in for happy hour great list of wines.,1
1849,Some may say this buffet is pricey but I think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot!,1
1850,I probably won't be coming back here.,0
1851,Worst food/service I've had in a while.,0
1852,This place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant.,1
1853,Talk about great customer service of course we will be back.,1

1855,I love their fries and their beans.,1
1856,Always a pleasure dealing with him.,1
1857,They have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything I've tried gets my seal of approval.,1

1859,For sushi on the Strip this is the place to go.,1
1860,The service was great even the manager came and helped with our table.,1
1861,The feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best.,0
1862,I started this review with two stars but I'm editing it to give it only one.,0
1863,this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides Costco's.,0

1872,I found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa.,0
1873,The service was terrible food was mediocre.,0
1874,We definately enjoyed ourselves.,1
1875,I ordered Albondigas soup - which was just warm - and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs.,0

1890,Highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron!,0
1891,Overall a great experience.,1
1892,Spend your money elsewhere.,0
1893,Their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter... Mmmm...!,1
1894,The Buffet at Bellagio was far from what I anticipated.,0
1895,And the drinks are WEAK people!,0
1896,-My order was not correct.,0
1897,Also I feel like the chips are bought not made in house.,0
1898,After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.,0
1899,The chips and sals a here is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
1900,We won't be returning.,0
1901,This is my new fav Vegas buffet spot.,1
1902,I seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.,0
1903,Very very sad.,0
1904,i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that?,0
1905,How can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can't properly cook a steak I don't understand!,0
1906,I'm not impressed with the concept or the food.,0
1907,The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as I don't like it puréed.,0

1913,This place is disgusting!,0
1914,Every time I eat here I see caring teamwork to a professional degree.,1
1915,The RI style calamari was a joke.,0
1916,However there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible.,0
1917,I could barely stomach the meal but didn't complain because it was a business lunch.,0
1918,It was so bad I had lost the heart to finish it.,0
1919,It also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it.,0
1920,We aren't ones to make a scene at restaurants but I just don't get it...definitely lost the love after this one!,0
1921,Disappointing experience.,0
1922,The food is about on par with Denny's which is to say not good at all.,0
1923,If you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you.,0
1924,WAAAAAAyyyyyyyyyy over rated is all I am saying.,0
1925,We won't be going back.,0
